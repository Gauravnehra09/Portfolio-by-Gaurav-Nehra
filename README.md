## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science in 2024 from a tier-3 college — not from IIT or NIT, and I haven’t worked at Google, Microsoft, or any FAANG company (yet!). But I bring the same hunger to learn, the same obsession with clean code, and a deep passion for building impactful software.

I am an analytical and diligent team player with strong problem-solving abilities. My technical toolkit includes C++, Data Structures, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React.js, Python, MySQL, DBMS, and MS Excel.

Additionally, I have completed an internship in web development, where I gained hands-on experience in building and maintaining websites. I am eager to leverage my technical skills to contribute effectively in a product-based company, where I can continue to learn and grow. With hands-on experience from my internships and a commitment to continuous learning, I am confident in my ability to excel and add value to any team I join.

I may not come from a big name — but I believe in building my name through action, consistency, and results
